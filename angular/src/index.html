     This file is not used. It is here to appease Angular.

     View priv/angular/browser/index.html to see the <script> and <link>
     tags Angular injects.

     View lib/ledger_web/components/layouts/root.html.heex to see the actual
     markup served by Phoenix.

     Any changes to the Angular-generated version of this file should be
     manually replicated on the Phoenix side.

     Phoenix is not allowed to serve the Angular-generated version of this file
     due to the static_path configuration in lib/ledger_web.ex.
