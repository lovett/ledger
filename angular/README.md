# Angular

This project was originally generated using Angular CLI version 19.1.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, go to the repository root and run:

```bash
mix phx.server
```

The application is served on `http://localhost:4002` and will automatically reload when Angular files are modified.

## Code scaffolding

To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
